##
# This is an exmaple FT case, feel free to modify/copy/add a new case based on it
#
# * Basic Tags
#  'description' - Write description for this case
#  'pre-run'     - Execute commands before 'run' tag. Generally for building project
#  'run'         - Run test case. Generally for start the program
#  'verify'      - Verify the results are all as our expected
#  'post-verify' - Execute commands after 'verify'. Generally cleanup the environment
#
# * Basic Macros (Use these macros instead of write the absolute path)
#  {COMMON} - This stands for the '$project/tests/common' folder
#  {RUN}    - This stands for the '$project/tests/run/$caseName/' folder
#  {CASE}   - This stands for the '$project/tests/cases/$caseName' folder
#
# * Start Location
#  When users run `skull build ft-check`, it will invoke the tests/Makefile to
#   execute the FT cases, and for each case, the framework will goto the
#   '$project/tests/run/$caseName' folder first, then run the case
#
# * Existing Scripts
#  skullft_mock_ep  - This script can help user to setup a mock end point easily
#                     Run `skullft_mock_ep -h` for the help
